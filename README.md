## PM-companies

*commercial process mining software*
* [Celonis](https://www.celonis.com) - company specialized on process mining founded 2011 in Munich, Germany <b>(market leader) </b>
* [Lana Labs](https://lanalabs.com/) - data can be integrated into their PM-software via open API, founded 2016 in Berlin, Germany
* [QPR Software](https://www.qpr.com/) - software & consulting company for business processes & trategy founded 1991, Helsinki, Finnland
* [PAFnow](https://pafnow.com/) - company offers PM-software integrable into Power BI, founded 2014
* [ProcessGold](https://processgold.com) - company offers process mining tool Eindhoven, Netherlands
* [ARIS Process Mining](https://www.softwareag.com/corporate/products/process/process_mining/default.html) - PM seems to only play a smaller part in the bigger ARIS suite that offers a wide variety of process modeling solutions (e.g. BPMN etc.)

*partially commercial process mining software*
* [Disco (fluxicon)](https://www.fluxicon.com/) - 2-person company dedicated to process mining, NS Eindhoven, Netherlands

## Libraries
*libraries that seem to be more advanced, preferential written in python*

* [pm4py](https://github.com/pm4py/pm4py-source) - Python library that contains process mining alorithms for python
* [pmlab](https://github.com/pmlab/pmlab-full) -  interactive programming environment for (exploratory) process mining 

## Tools
*single implementations of certain process mining alorithms, that could help in certain fields of application*

* [pyalpha](https://github.com/zhoudaxia233/pyalpha) - Python tool that generates a Petri net using the Alpha Algorithm from event logs
* [csv2xes](https://github.com/rudeigerc/csv2xes) - python tool converting .csv file to .xes 

## JupyterNotebooks
*collection of nice process mining relevant jupyter notebooks*

* [alpha miner implementation.ipynb](https://github.com/mehdi149/Learning-projects/blob/master/Alpha%20miner%20implementation.ipynb) - implementation of alpha miner alorithm, input is csv, visualization of petri-net output with graphviz and sankes plugins
* [pmlab-exercises](https://github.com/pmlab/pmlab-exercises/tree/master/from-scratch) - code snippets for usage of PMLab library mentioned unter [Libraries](#libraries)
 
## FurtherResources
*collection of free information, books etc. about process mining*

* [Process Mining Book](https://fluxicon.com/book/read/#)
* [International Conference on Process Mining (ICPM)](https://icpmconference.org)
 
 
## FutureTrends
*possible future developments in the area of process mining*

* interation of <b>Machine Learning Technologies</b>
    * to detect e.g. anomalies in process chains (e.g. fraud detection)
    * deviations to desired throughput time within certain process automatically trigger a recommended action
