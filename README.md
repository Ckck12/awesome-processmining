## Libraries
*libraries that seem to be more advanced, preferential written in python*

* [pm4py](https://github.com/pm4py/pm4py-source) - Python library that contains process mining alorithms for python

## Tools
*single implementations of certain process mining alorithms, that could help in certain fields of application*

* [pyalpha](https://github.com/zhoudaxia233/pyalpha) - Python tool that generates a Petri net using the Alpha Algorithm from event logs
* [csv2xes](https://github.com/rudeigerc/csv2xes) - python tool converting .csv file to .xes 

## Jupyter Notebooks
*collection of nice process mining relevant jupyter notebooks*

* [alpha miner implementation.ipynb](https://github.com/mehdi149/Learning-projects/blob/master/Alpha%20miner%20implementation.ipynb) - implementation of alpha miner alorithm, input is csv, visualization of petri-net output with graphviz and sankes plugins
