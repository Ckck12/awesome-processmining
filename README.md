What is Process Mining (PM) ? <br>
*→ process of extracting valuable information from event logs/databases that are generated by processes.*
 * process discovery: analysing event data to see how a process actually looks like
 * conformance checking: comparing mined process to the reference model (=the process how it should be)
 * prediction: predicting e.g the state or point of time a future event has/occurs  

Why Process Mining ? <br>
* → identifying hidden nodes and bottlenecks in business processes.

## FutureTrends
*possible future developments in the area of process mining*

* interation of <b>Machine Learning Technologies</b>
    * to detect e.g. anomalies in process chains (e.g. fraud detection)
    * deviations to desired throughput time within certain process automatically trigger a recommended action
